# A-Learning-System
A learning system using python, tkinter and mySQL



HOW IT WORKS-

This programme designs a Cryptography learning platform.
A predefined database is present on my system which is linked to this program. (I am not uploading the database.)
As the program runs, a login page opens up and the user has to enter the login ID registered over his name (assuming the user to know the id, and taking one such id from the predefined database.) and the name of the user who is logging in at that moment (might not be the same as stored in the database.)
Once the id is entered, the program checks whether the id is present in the existing database. If present, it allows the user to proceed to the next page. But if not, then it displays an error.

The user can create a new id using the 'sign up' option and register himself. As the user clicks that option a dialog box pops out, which asks for the username.
Now on confirming the name, an entry is done in the existing database.

Another dialog box pops out, by which the user can know the ID registered upon his name, or can also register another name into the database.

The exit button in the main window will close the entire program.



FUTURE MODIFICATIONS-

There is only one page of information at present. Futher pages can be added.
Many other user entry fields can be added into the database.
